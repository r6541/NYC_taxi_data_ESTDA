This repo was created to be able to test the dataset easily. It contains a stratified sample of the original NYC Taxi trip data (0.05). The file was originally 2.2GB for January only. After adding STB, the file became 5.1 GB. After creating the stratified sample, the file is 257MB. 
To be able to upload the dataset to GitHub, the file had to be less than 25MB. We tried (0.005), but that was slightly larger than 25MB, we then tried (0.0045), which made the dataset 23.1 MB.
